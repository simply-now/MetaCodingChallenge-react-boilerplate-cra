# Meta Coding challenge
[Live Site](https://agitated-shannon-839440.netlify.app/)
## Starting from React Boiler plate to both speed up the assessment and show working with a existing tools and projects.

### Plan and assumptions

#### Assumptions:
 - Page 1 of the pdf is the mockup, Colors and relative sizes are pulled from there.
 - Fix or relative Height percentage of the blue section is the set size for Mobile tablet screens
 - The text change should be changed via a react class or set value and not vanilla javascript (I don't know how similar/equivalent but different technical decisions would be picked).
 - Colors, fonts, and sizes noted in the styles file are correct. (These could easily be swapped to be correct but hopefully they are accurate)
   - Colors pulled from the pdf
   - Fonts pulled from https://about.facebook.com/meta/
   - Sizes pulled from the pdf
   - Some other things like icons/svg files etc. pulled from https://about.facebook.com/meta/

#### Plan:
 - Plan out project and gather resources and tools for it
 - Add in some dependencies and tools for development
 - Finish testing deployment and Dev Environment
 - Build Matching page with styled components (would prefer to use SCSS but Styled components seem like a good or better option are are what this boilerplate uses.)
 - Pull in React Scroll code and implement and test it basic setup changing just the text to match the requirements.
 - Test and fix for mobile issues, if any (see assumptions).
